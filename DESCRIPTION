Description: An omnibus test of change-point Cox regression models to improve the statistical power of detecting signals of non-proportional hazards patterns. The technical details can be found in Hong Zhang, Qing Li, Devan Mehrotra and Judong Shen (2021) <arXiv:2101.00059>. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that, compared to existing tests under non-proportional hazards, the proposed CauchyCP test 1) controls the type I error better at small alpha levels; 2) increases the power of detecting time-varying effects; and 3) is more computationally efficient.
